# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving Wayproof. Contributions
of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, source-backed data corrections, and code.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/wayproof.git
cd wayproof
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Development guidelines

- **Tests must pass.** Run `python -m pytest tests/` before opening a PR; add a
  test for any new behavior or fixed bug. Name it after the failure it catches.
- **Match the surrounding style.** Type hints, module docstrings, and concise
  comments that explain *why*, as in the existing code.
- **Keep changes focused.** One logical change per PR with a clear description.
- **Data changes:** if you correct peak data, cite the authoritative source
  (USGS GNIS, the official SPS list). Do not commit copyrighted source
  documents — see `DATA_LICENSE.md`. New data sources should be Tier A
  (federal/public) where one exists; a Tier C source (Peakbagger,
  SummitPost, guidebooks, blogs) can justify a fact but its content isn't
  copied into the project's own database — see `DATA_LICENSE.md`'s Source
  Policy section.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Open an issue using the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. For a data
correction, confirmation, or something missing (a peak, trailhead, permit,
water source, campground, etc.), use the "Data report" template -- see the
`report.py --help` and `wayproof/reports.py` for how these get reviewed and
turned into the actual dataset via `report.py`.
