"""Channel-agnostic core for the scavenger-hunt data loop: what's unconfirmed
or missing (:func:`open_questions`), and how someone reports back on it
(:func:`submit_report`).

The design goal is that CLI is the only *caller* of this today, and a GitHub
issue template, an MCP tool for Claude, a ChatGPT Action, or a website form
can each become an additional caller later without changing this module --
they'd all just build an ``OpenQuestion``/submit a ``Report`` the same way
``plan.py`` already does. Nothing here assumes a specific channel; ``channel``
on :class:`Report` is just metadata about where a submission came from.

``open_questions`` deliberately *derives* its list from confidence signals
already present in the domain data (an ``unconfirmed`` approach status, a
water source with no coordinates, two log entries that disagree, a note
containing "approximate") rather than from a hand-authored, separately
maintained list -- a static list drifts out of sync with the data it's
describing; a derived one can't.

Peak-scoped filtering (``peak_names``) is intentionally conservative: it only
includes gaps this module can link to a requested peak with real confidence
(an approach row's own ``peak_name``, a peak's own coordinate flag, or a
water source whose ``location`` matches that peak's ``nearest_trailhead``).
Campground- and campsite-level gaps aren't peak-filterable yet -- there's no
reliable link from a campground's ``park`` field to a specific peak's
trailhead (they use different naming granularity today), and a wrong-looking
"this is relevant to your trip" claim is worse than omitting it. Those gaps
still surface in the unfiltered (``peak_names=None``) view. See the "Known
follow-ups" note this leaves in DATA_LICENSE.md.

``submit_report`` writes to ``data/pending_reports.csv``, an intake queue
deliberately separate from the resolved domain ledgers (``water_source_log.csv``
etc.) -- a submission is a claim to review, not yet a fact. Accepting one is
still a manual step: the maintainer transcribes it into the relevant CSV,
citing the report ID, then calls :func:`resolve_report` to close it out.
