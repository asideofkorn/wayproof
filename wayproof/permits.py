"""Permit requirements for planned trips.

Wilderness permit rules (issuing agency, quota season, reservation window) are
curated in ``data/permits.csv``, keyed by the ``permit_group`` each trailhead
in ``data/trailheads.csv`` is tagged with. This module joins a cluster's
trailhead to its permit rule and, given a candidate trip start date, works out
whether that date falls in the quota season and when the reservation window
opens.

*When* a permit_group's inventory actually becomes available -- a single
rolling release, a percentage-split release, an annual lottery, a walk-up-only
system, or one requiring direct contact off-season -- is computed generically
from ``data/release_policies.csv`` (see :mod:`wayproof.release_policy`)
rather than special-cased per group in this module. That closed a real gap:
previously, a permit_group with e.g. a 60%-then-40% split release only ever
had its *first* release date computed; the second release existed only as a
sentence in ``reservation_method``, never as a date the tool itself could act
on. Yosemite's weekly lottery is the one deliberate exception still handled
inline below -- see :mod:`wayproof.release_policy` for why.

A permit's issuing agency is the trailhead's agency, not necessarily the
agency governing every peak reached from it: Sierra Nevada wilderness permits
are interagency -- a permit issued for the trailhead you start at is honored
for the rest of the trip, even where the route crosses into a neighboring
wilderness or national park (e.g. a Sierra NF permit picked up at the
Isberg/Clover Meadow trailhead covers the leg into Yosemite over Isberg Pass;
an Emigrant Wilderness self-issue permit covers a route that crosses into
Yosemite at Bond Pass). You do *not* need a second permit from the agency
whose land you pass through.

Per Inyo NF's own wording, this reciprocity requires *continuous* wilderness
travel: exiting the wilderness and re-entering elsewhere voids the permit and
requires a new one from the agency where that next section begins, EXCEPT a
reasonable resupply break for long-distance through-hikers. For the single-
trailhead loop trips this tool plans, that condition is always satisfied.
Each :class:`PermitRule` carries an ``interagency_note`` documenting where
reciprocity applies; a handful of boundary crossings have their own
procedural wrinkle on top of it (e.g. Kibbie Lake / Lake Eleanor out of
Stanislaus NF requires calling Yosemite's Groveland Ranger District a day
ahead) -- see the note before assuming blanket reciprocity.

Rules and dates shift year to year (recreation.gov release times, lottery
windows, exact quota-season start/end). Treat this as a planning aid, not a
booking guarantee -- always confirm against the ``apply_url`` before relying
on a date.

A trailhead's permit_group is a default, not a guarantee for every peak
reached from it: some trailheads serve more than one permitted trail with
different rules (e.g. Whitney Portal serves the lottery-only classic Mt.
Whitney Trail, but also the separately-permitted Mountaineers Route /
North Fork of Lone Pine Creek trail for Mount Russell). ``data/approaches.csv``
(see :mod:`wayproof.access`) records these peak-specific approach
relationships as structured data: which named route a peak uses, which
trailhead it starts from, and -- when a source directly confirms it -- which
permit_group actually governs it. :func:`clusters_permit_info` emits an
extra, peak-specific entry for each confirmed relationship that differs from
the trailhead default.

Some cases are plausible but not directly confirmed by a source (e.g. Mount
Irvine and Mount Mallory's source-listed trailhead names the Meysan Lake
Trail, a different route than Whitney Portal's main trail, but no source
confirms which permit product actually governs it). Rather than silently
assuming the trailhead default or silently omitting the peak,
``data/approaches.csv`` can record these with ``status=unconfirmed``;
:func:`clusters_permit_info` then emits an explicit caution alongside the
default entry instead of asserting an unverified answer. Treat any peak
sharing a trailhead with a lottery/special permit as worth double-checking if
its standard route isn't the trailhead's main trail, even when it has no row
here yet.

``data/permits.csv`` only stores the current best-known answer per
permit_group -- each edit overwrites the last one, so on its own it can't
reveal that two different sources disagreed. ``data/permit_source_log.csv``
is the append-only complement: one row per verification event (never
edited, only appended to), recording the source URL, the source's own
"last updated" date, how it was checked, and a verdict of ``new-group``,
``confirms-existing``, ``corrects-existing``, or ``unresolved-conflict``.
When a new source disagrees with what's already logged, log it as
``unresolved-conflict`` first (don't silently pick one), then once it's
reconciled -- by updating ``data/permits.csv`` and appending a follow-up
``corrects-existing`` entry explaining which source won and why -- the
disagreement closes, because the log is read in chronological order.

Conflicts are tracked per ``(permit_group, conflict_id)``, not per
permit_group. That distinction was learned the hard way: Desolation opened
three unrelated disagreements in one session (whether day-use permits are
year-round or quota-season-only, which fee tier applies, and whether the
Special Management Area setback is 25 or 30 feet). With group-level
tracking, resolving any one of them closed all three, because only the
group's last entry was read. Closing a conflict that is still open is worse
than not tracking it at all -- it converts a known unknown into a silent
wrong answer -- so the workaround at the time was to leave a resolved
verdict deliberately dirty, which does not survive a third conflict.

:func:`open_conflicts` reports each open disagreement separately;
:func:`unresolved_conflicts` rolls those up to the permit_groups affected.
A resolving entry closes only the ``conflict_id`` it names, so a generic
``confirms-existing`` row never silently closes a specific identified
disagreement. Entries with no ``conflict_id`` share one per-group bucket,
which is the old behaviour and is fine for a group that only ever has one
conflict open at a time.
