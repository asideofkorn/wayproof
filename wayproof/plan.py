"""Resolve trip logistics for a specific, named set of objectives.

Unlike the experimental geographic clustering pipeline
(:mod:`wayproof.clustering` / :mod:`wayproof.tsp`), this module does
not discover or group objectives -- it assumes the user already knows what
they want to do (e.g. "Mount Williamson and Mount Tyndall") and answers: what
access applies, what permit governs it, when do you need to act, and what
evidence backs the answer?

Almost nothing here is new domain logic. :func:`resolve_plan` looks the named
objectives up, picks their shared trailhead with
:func:`wayproof.approach.choose_trailhead`, wraps them in a single-use
:class:`~wayproof.model.Cluster`, and hands that to
:func:`wayproof.permits.clusters_permit_info` -- reusing the approach
override/uncertainty handling and computable release-rule dates already
built for the clustering pipeline, rather than duplicating any of it.

Current scope, deliberately: a plan's objectives must share a single
trailhead, the same assumption already made everywhere else access is
modeled in this project (a ``Cluster`` has exactly one ``trailhead``).
Objectives that don't share one aren't rejected -- ``resolve_plan`` still
picks its best guess and reports the mismatch as a warning rather than
silently trusting it. A loop or point-to-point traverse with a genuinely
different entry and exit (e.g. an Evolution Loop-style objective) needs an
explicit entry/exit pair, which is a natural additive extension, not
something this module models yet.
