"""Backcountry water sources and their append-only availability ledger.

Unlike a coordinate or an elevation, "is this water source currently
running" is not a fact that stays true once recorded -- a spigot fed by a
spring can run dry (or start running again) with no announcement. Treating
that as a single mutable field would silently discard the previous answer
every time it's rechecked, and would flatten "an official source says it's
running" and "a hiker says it looked dry last week" into the same kind of
claim.

``data/water_sources.csv`` holds the static facts (name, type, associated
trailhead/campground). ``data/water_source_log.csv`` is the append-only
ledger of dated checks against it -- the same confirms/conflicts pattern as
:mod:`wayproof.permits`'s ``SourceLogEntry``, generalized to a fact that
isn't a permit at all. A source can accumulate an official check and a
firsthand field report on different dates, and a later check never erases an
earlier one -- see :func:`latest_status_by_source` for reducing the ledger
down to the newest entry per source. ``observed_status`` is free text rather
than a controlled vocabulary (unlike :mod:`wayproof.permits`'s
``SourceLogEntry.verdict``), so a genuine disagreement between two entries --
e.g. an official source saying a spigot is available while this project's own
trip notes say otherwise -- is something a human records explicitly in
``notes`` rather than something this module detects automatically.
