"""View models for wayproof.dev's generated pages.

A "view" here is a plain dict: everything one published page asserts, resolved
from the domain data and nothing else. :mod:`wayproof.render` turns a view into
HTML, Markdown, or JSON.

The split matters more than usual for this project. Every page ships in three
representations (human HTML, agent Markdown, structured JSON), and a site whose
whole claim is "these facts are sourced and consistent" cannot afford the agent
surface to say something the human one doesn't. Resolving once into a dict and
rendering three times makes disagreement impossible by construction, rather
than by discipline.

Trailhead views are deliberately **permit-led**. A trailhead's authoritative,
sourced content is its access and permit rule -- the agency, the quota season,
the release mechanics, the fees. Its peak list is not: ``nearest_trailhead``
in ``data/peaks.csv`` is a *geometric* assignment computed by
``scripts/assign_trailheads.py``, not a curated approach relationship, and
permits attach to where you *enter* rather than to whatever summit happens to
be closest (a JMT hiker entering at Happy Isles carries that permit past peaks
whose nearest road is hundreds of miles of trail away). So proximity-derived
peaks appear only as an explicitly labelled, secondary signal, while
``data/approaches.csv``'s sourced rows -- the ones that actually know which
permit governs a named route -- are surfaced as first-class facts.
