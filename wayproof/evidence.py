"""Linking a stored claim to the verification events behind it.

``data/permit_source_log.csv`` has always recorded *why* this project believes
things. What it could not do is tell you which belief a given entry supports,
or which entries stand behind a given claim. The log was a diary, not an index,
so a reader who doubted one sentence on a page had no way to reach the evidence
for that sentence, and a maintainer who found a source had changed had no way
to learn which rows depended on it.

Both are the same missing edge, traversed in opposite directions:

- **Forward**, for a reader: claim -> entries -> sources. "Where does this come
  from, and is anyone arguing about it?"
- **Backward**, for ingestion: source URL -> entries -> claims. "This page
  changed overnight. What do I have to re-check?"

So every log entry now carries a stable ``entry_id`` (``group-date-seq``,
sayable out loud and sortable), and a claim cites the ids that established it.
:func:`evidence_for` walks forward, :func:`claims_citing_url` walks back.

The status a claim gets is deliberately three-valued rather than a boolean.
``SETTLED`` means verified with nothing open against it. ``CONTESTED`` means a
cited entry belongs to a conflict still open, so the value is this project's
best pick and a reader should know that before acting. ``UNVERIFIED`` means no
entry is cited at all, which is different from "checked and fine" and must not
render as if it were. A fourth state is folded into ``SETTLED`` on purpose: a
claim whose conflict was opened and then closed is settled, but
:attr:`ClaimEvidence.closed_conflicts` keeps the argument visible, because "we
considered this and resolved it" is more reassuring to a sceptical reader than
silence, and more useful to the next maintainer than a clean slate.
