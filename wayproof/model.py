    Conceptually, ``Peak`` is one *type* of place-based objective this
    project can plan around; a named list like the Sierra Peaks Section is
    one **collection** of such objectives (see :attr:`collection`), not the
    ontology of the whole project. Loop routes, traverses, and multi-peak
    objectives that aren't a single summit are a natural extension of this
    same idea, not modeled here yet.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Human-readable peak name (used as the unique key throughout the tool).
    latitude, longitude : float
        Decimal degrees (WGS84). Longitude is negative in the western hemisphere.
    elevation_ft : float
        Summit elevation in feet.
    region : str
        Optional grouping label (e.g. "Palisades"). Informational only.
    meta : dict
        Optional extra attributes carried from the source data (class, section,
        emblem/mountaineers flags, round-trip mileage, gain, trailhead, quad...).
        Surfaced in the JSON export but not used by the geometry/grouping.
