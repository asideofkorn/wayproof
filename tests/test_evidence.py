"""Tests for linking a claim to the verification events behind it.

Two directions of one edge. Forward, a reader asks "where does this come from,
and is anyone arguing about it". Backward, ingestion asks "this page changed,
what do I re-check". Both were unanswerable while the log was a diary with no
index.

Run with:  python -m pytest tests/test_evidence.py
