# Wayproof

Open-source, source-backed logistics for hiking, trail running, backpacking, and
mountaineering. Sierra Nevada first; designed to expand to U.S. public lands.

Turn an outdoor objective into a trip you can actually execute: approaches,
access, effort, permits, booking deadlines, and evidence.

This repository began as a tool for grouping the Sierra Peaks Section (SPS) list
into possible multi-peak trips. That experimental geographic-planning code is
still part of the project, but it exposed a more important problem: in the
mountains, proximity is not the same thing as feasibility.

Two summits can be close on a map and still be separated by technical ridges,
cliffs, difficult talus, snow or ice, creek crossings, private land, major
descents and reclimbs, or simply no sensible route connection.

The project is therefore evolving around a different question:

**I want to do this objective on this date. What do I need to know and do to make
the trip happen?**

Today the data and tooling are Sierra Nevada- and SPS-focused. The longer-term
architecture is intended to support other U.S. public lands without pretending
that nationwide coverage exists yet.

## The Planning Problem

Suppose you want to climb Mount Williamson and Mount Tyndall over three days in
July 2027.

Knowing that the summits are geographically near one another is useful, but it
is not enough to plan the trip.

The useful questions are:

- Do the objectives share a practical or commonly used approach?
- Which trailhead or wilderness entry point is relevant?
- Which wilderness area and land-management agency control the entry?
- Which permit product or permit group applies?
- When does reservation inventory become available?
- Is there a later or fallback release window?
- What approach effort is involved before the summit-to-summit portion even
  begins?
- Which facts are directly supported by source data, which are inferred, and
  which remain uncertain?
- What official sources support the access and permit rules?

That relationship between objective -> approach -> access -> permit -> timing ->
evidence is the direction of the project.

Wayproof is not intended to replace CalTopo, Gaia GPS,
AllTrails, Strava Routes, or other detailed mapping and navigation tools. Those
products are better suited to drawing, inspecting, and navigating exact routes.
This project is focused on the logistical knowledge around the trip: what access
applies, what rules matter, when you need to act, and what evidence supports the
answer.

## `plan`: Objective + Date -> Logistics

`plan.py` is that answer, for objectives you already know you want to do. Unlike
`cli.py`'s experimental geographic clustering (which discovers and groups
objectives from a whole peak list), `plan` takes specific, named objectives and
resolves access, permit, and evidence logistics for them directly -- no
clustering or route discovery involved.

```bash
python plan.py "Mount Williamson" "Mount Tyndall" --date 2027-07-15
```

  These are each objective's own official round-trip stats from its standard
  trailhead -- not a computed combined route. Whether they can reasonably be
  linked into one continuous trip is not modeled here; treat as reference
  points, not a verified itinerary.

Planning aid, not a booking guarantee -- verify the current rule at the
official source before acting on any date above.
```

A trailhead shared by objectives with different actual approaches -- e.g. Mount
Whitney and Mount Russell from Whitney Portal -- surfaces both permits it
actually needs, using the same approach-relationship data described below:

```bash
python plan.py "Mount Whitney" "Mount Russell" --date 2027-07-01
```

`--output plan.json` writes the same resolution as structured JSON (objectives,
trailhead, every permit entry, warnings) for downstream use.

**Current scope, deliberately:** `plan`'s objectives must share a single
trailhead, the same assumption made everywhere else access is modeled in this
project. Objectives that don't share one aren't rejected -- `plan` still
resolves its best guess and reports the mismatch as an explicit warning rather
than silently trusting it. A loop or point-to-point traverse with a genuinely
different entry and exit is a natural next step, not something this models yet.

### How the entry point itself was resolved

The permit above is only as good as the objective -> entry-point link behind
it, and today that link is usually `nearest_trailhead`: straight-line geometry
computed by `scripts/assign_trailheads.py`, the same field the website labels
"UNVERIFIED: assigned by straight-line proximity, not by a confirmed approach
relationship". Reporting a permit off it under a verification date implies the
whole chain was checked. So `plan` states the link's own basis, per objective:

| Basis | Meaning | SPS peaks |
|---|---|---:|
| `sourced` | `data/approaches.csv` confirms the route and its permit | 1 |
| `route_consistent` | the objective's own sourced route name starts at this trailhead | 59 |
| `contradicted` | its sourced route starts somewhere **else** -- raises a warning | 31 |
| `corridor` | its sourced route is the PCT/JMT, which has no single entry point | 13 |
| `inferred` | straight-line proximity only | 143 |

A `contradicted` objective warns, and says whether the disagreement changes the
permit product (7 of the 31 do) or only the trailhead shown. The sharpest case
is Mount LeConte: geometry picks Whitney Portal, so the plan would send you into
the Whitney Zone lottery -- a Feb 1 - Mar 1 window -- for a peak whose sourced
route needs an ordinary Inyo NF rolling reservation.

```text
Access
  Trailhead: Mineral King  (west side)
  Entry basis (Picket Guard Peak): contradicted -- DISAGREES with the
  objective's own sourced route (Shepherd Pass Trail), which starts at
  Shepherd Pass -- see Warnings.
```

187 of 247 SPS objectives currently have no sourced entry relationship
(`contradicted` + `corridor` + `inferred`). That number is the size of the
remaining work, and there is a test asserting it so it can only go down.

```bash
python plan.py --help
```

## What The Project Can Do Today

The current implementation is centered on the Sierra Nevada and the Sierra Peaks
Section dataset.

It can:

- Resolve access, permit, and evidence logistics for a specific, named set of
  objectives and a trip date (`plan.py`), without going through the
  experimental clustering pipeline.
- Load the 247-peak SPS list with summit coordinates, elevation, class, section,
  emblem and mountaineers flags, mileage/gain fields, trailhead metadata, USGS
  quad, and source metadata.
- Work with a curated Sierra trailhead dataset containing location, side of the
  range, wilderness area, land agency, and permit-group relationships.
- Estimate approach effort when trailhead and peak-approach data are available.
- Report permit logistics for a planned trip date, including quota season,
  reservation window, application method, fees, official application URL, and
  provenance dates.
- Preserve an append-only history of permit-source verification, including
  conflicting evidence.
- Apply explicitly sourced, peak-specific approach relationships when a
  trailhead's default permit is not sufficient for a particular objective,
  including flagging suspected-but-unconfirmed cases rather than guessing.
- Generate experimental geographic candidate groupings for SPS peaks using
  proximity, effort estimates, optional pass-aware distance calculations, and
  TSP-based sequencing.
- Export structured JSON and generate maps/charts for inspecting those candidate
  groupings.

The geographic grouping capability is useful for discovery. It is not an
authoritative mountain-routing engine.

## Trust, Provenance, And Permit Verification

Permit and access rules are unusually easy to get wrong.

Rules change. Agency pages move. An old PDF may still be online after a newer
webpage has superseded it. Recreation.gov may describe a rule differently from
the land manager's own page. Two official sources can even appear to contradict
one another.

For that reason, Wayproof separates the project's current
structured answer from the evidence history used to reach it.

### Current Permit Data

`data/permits.csv` stores the project's current best structured representation
of each permit group, including fields such as:

- issuing agency
- permit type
- quota requirement
- quota season
- reservation window
- reservation method
- fees or fee notes
- official application URL
- explanatory notes
- source update date
- verification date

Every permit row carries two different dates:

`source_last_updated` is the date the source itself says it was updated, where
that information is available.

`verified_date` is the date this project last checked the structured data
against that source.

Those are intentionally different concepts. A government page last updated in
2024 may still be the current authoritative source and may have been checked by
this project yesterday. Conversely, a recently updated source has not been
independently verified here until the dataset has actually been compared against
it.

An old source date or missing verification date should be treated as a reason to
re-check the linked primary source before relying on a booking deadline.

### Append-Only Source History

`data/permit_source_log.csv` is the append-only verification ledger for permit
data.

It records individual source checks rather than only storing the latest answer.
A log entry includes the permit group, source URL, source date where available,
how the evidence was obtained, notes about what the source says, a verification
verdict, and an optional `conflict_id` naming the specific disagreement the
entry opens, restates, or closes.

The current verdicts are:

- `new-group` - the evidence establishes a permit group or rule that was not
  previously represented.
- `confirms-existing` - the evidence agrees with the current structured data.
- `corrects-existing` - authoritative evidence establishes that the structured
  data should be changed.
- `unresolved-conflict` - available evidence disagrees or is insufficient to
  determine which interpretation is correct.

The important rule is that history is not rewritten when the answer changes.

If a newly discovered source disagrees with the current dataset, record that
disagreement first. Do not silently replace the old value and erase the fact that
conflicting evidence existed.

Once the conflict is resolved, for example because one source is newer, more
authoritative, or more specific to the trailhead or permit product, update the
current structured value in `permits.csv` and append a new `corrects-existing`
verification event explaining the resolution.

The earlier conflicting record remains in the ledger. It simply stops
representing the current unresolved state.

#### One group can be carrying several arguments at once

Conflicts are tracked per `(permit_group, conflict_id)`, not per permit group.
Desolation opened three unrelated disagreements in a single session -- whether
day-use permits are required year-round or only in quota season, which fee tier
applies, and whether the Special Management Area camping setback is 25 or 30
feet. With group-level tracking, resolving any one of them closed all three,
because only the group's last entry was read. Closing a conflict that is still
open is worse than not tracking it at all: it turns a known unknown into a
silent wrong answer.

So a resolving entry closes only the `conflict_id` it names. An entry naming a
different id leaves the others exactly as they were, and an entry naming none
cannot quietly settle a specific identified dispute -- a routine re-check of a
permit's fee does not resolve an open argument about its season. Entries with a
blank `conflict_id` share one per-group bucket, which is fine for a group that
only ever has one conflict open at a time.

Open conflicts also appear in `--open-questions` and on the website's gaps list.
They are the sharpest kind of gap in the dataset: not "nobody has checked" but
"two sources were checked and they disagree", with a value stored anyway.

This gives the project two complementary views:

- `permits.csv` answers "What does the project currently believe?"
- `permit_source_log.csv` answers "Why does it believe that, and what
  contradictory evidence has existed?"

Inspect the history with:

```bash
python cli.py --permit-sources whitney_zone
python cli.py --permit-sources
```

The second form surfaces unresolved conflicts across permit groups.

### Approaches: Modeling Real Permit Relationships

A trailhead's `permit_group` is a useful default, but it is not always
sufficient to determine the permit for every objective accessible from that
area.

Whitney Portal is the clearest example.

Mount Whitney via the classic Mt. Whitney Trail is subject to the
Whitney-specific permit system. But nearby objectives can use different entry
routes. Mount Russell, for example, is commonly approached through the North Fork
of Lone Pine Creek rather than the Main Trail, and Inyo National Forest treats
that access differently from the Mt. Whitney Trail lottery.

That means a simplistic rule such as:

```text
Whitney Portal -> Whitney lottery
```

can produce the wrong answer for a peak reached from the same trailhead by a
different route.

`data/approaches.csv` (loaded by `wayproof/access.py`) models this as an
explicit relationship rather than an opaque peak-name patch: which peak, which
named approach/route, which trailhead it starts from, and -- when a source
confirms it -- which permit product actually governs it. Each row carries:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `peak_name` | The objective this approach serves |
| `trailhead` | The entry point the approach starts from |
| `approach_name` | The named route (e.g. "Mountaineers Route / North Fork of Lone Pine Creek") |
| `permit_group` | The permit product this approach uses; blank when unconfirmed |
| `status` | `confirmed` or `unconfirmed` |
| `source_url`, `verified_date`, `notes` | Provenance for this specific relationship |

A `confirmed` row is backed by a source that directly states the peak's real
approach uses a different permit than its trailhead's default (e.g. Mount
Russell -> `inyo_jmw_aaw`, not Whitney Portal's default `whitney_zone`).
`clusters_permit_info` emits an extra, peak-specific permit entry for it.

Not every uncertainty has a confirmed answer yet. Mount Irvine and Mount
Mallory's source-listed trailhead names the Meysan Lake Trail -- a different
route than Whitney Portal's main trail -- but no source has been found
confirming which permit product actually governs it. Rather than silently
assuming the trailhead default, or silently dropping the peak, these are
recorded with `status=unconfirmed`, and the permit report surfaces an explicit
`UNCERTAIN` caution for that peak instead of a fabricated answer:

```text
Group #0 -- Whitney Portal  [UNCERTAIN for Mount Irvine: approach may be
Meysan Lake Trail, not confirmed against a source -- do not assume the
Whitney Portal default above applies without verifying independently. ...]
```

This is the concrete first piece of the project's longer-term planning graph:
objective -> approach -> entry point -> land unit -> permit product -> rule.
`LandUnit` and `PermitProduct` are still simple inline fields on trailheads
and `permits.csv` today rather than fully separate tables -- a deliberate
scope decision while coverage stays Sierra-only, not an oversight.

New approach rows should be:

- explicit,
- conservative (only added when there is a concrete reason -- a named
  alternate trail, a source, or both -- to question the trailhead default),
- and clearly marked `unconfirmed` rather than guessed at when the governing
  permit isn't directly sourced.

Planning aid, not booking guarantee: quota seasons, reservation windows, lottery
rules, and release policies can change. Before acting on a real deadline,
confirm the current rule at the official URL referenced by the dataset.

## Current Coverage And Limitations

Current coverage is Sierra Nevada- and SPS-focused, plus a first step outside
it: Rose Peak and Mission Peak (Diablo Range, Alameda County), added to
`data/peaks.csv` with no SPS collection row, on East Bay Regional Park
District land with a genuinely different access model (no wilderness permit,
a campsite reservation instead, and a vehicle day-use fee with its own
exemptions) -- see the "Campgrounds And Facilities" section below.

The repository currently includes:

- `data/peaks.csv` - collection-agnostic summit identity: name, coordinates, elevation, region, nearest-trailhead access signal
- `data/collections/sps.csv` - the SPS collection layer: list membership, section, class, official mileage/gain, benchmark rating
- `data/trailheads.csv` - curated trailheads and access metadata (Sierra Nevada plus, as of Rose Peak/Mission Peak, the East Bay's Diablo Range)
- `data/permits.csv` - structured wilderness-entry permit rules
- `data/release_policies.csv` - structured, computable permit release phases
- `data/approaches.csv` - peak-specific approach/permit relationships, confirmed and unconfirmed
- `data/permit_source_log.csv` - append-only permit verification history
- `data/campgrounds.csv` / `data/campsites.csv` - backpack campgrounds and their individually-bookable sites
- `data/water_sources.csv` / `data/water_source_log.csv` - named backcountry water sources and an append-only ledger of dated availability checks (a source can go dry with no announcement, so a later check never overwrites an earlier one)
- `data/park_access.csv` - park-level vehicle entrance fees, gate hours, and fee exemptions (distinct from a wilderness permit or a campsite reservation)
- `data/passes.csv` - Sierra pass data used for optional coarse cross-crest
  distance estimates
- `data/permit_zones.csv` - bookable destination zones for permit groups
  whose quota attaches to a destination rather than an entry point
- `data/regulations.csv` - rules in force once you hold a permit (fire, food
  storage, waste, pets, stock), scoped by state, agency, or permit group

The project does not currently:

- provide comprehensive U.S. public-land coverage,
- check live Recreation.gov inventory,
- model complete trail topology,
- determine whether off-trail terrain is technically passable,
- evaluate current snow, ice, creek, avalanche, wildfire, or weather conditions,
- resolve `plan` objectives that don't share a single trailhead (a loop or
  point-to-point traverse with a distinct entry and exit isn't modeled yet),
- or certify that a generated peak sequence is a safe or feasible route.

Use the following terms deliberately:

- **Candidate grouping** - a set of objectives generated from geometry and
  planning heuristics.
- **Candidate sequence** - a suggested ordering of those objectives; not verified
  travel between them.
- **Known approach** - an approach relationship represented by actual project
  data rather than inferred only from geometric proximity.
- **Verified rule** - a logistical rule supported by authoritative source
  evidence.
- **Unresolved / uncertain** - the available evidence does not justify a
  confident conclusion.

Do not describe generated clustering output as a "verified route."

## Campgrounds And Facilities

Some access facts don't fit the permit model at all -- water availability
that changes with no announcement, a campsite's proximity to a shared
restroom, a park's vehicle entrance fee and gate hours. These were added
alongside this project's first peaks outside the Sierra Nevada / SPS
collection (Rose Peak, Mission Peak; East Bay Regional Park District's
Diablo Range land), which use a genuinely different access model than
anything in the Sierra data: no wilderness entry permit, a campsite
reservation instead, and a separate park-level day-use fee with its own
exemptions.

- **`data/campgrounds.csv`** / **`data/campsites.csv`** -- a campground is a
  physical cluster with shared facilities (one restroom, one water source,
  one reservation contact); a campsite is an individually-bookable unit
  within one. Most campgrounds in this dataset are effectively a single
  site, but some (Sunol Backpack Camp) contain several named sites that
  share the campground's facilities yet have a genuinely different
  proximity to them -- Hawks Nest is documented as closer to both water and
  the restroom than Sunol Backpack Camp's other six sites. A campground
  with no differentiated sub-sites has no rows in `campsites.csv` at all,
  rather than a placeholder row repeating the campground's own name.
- **`data/water_sources.csv`** / **`data/water_source_log.csv`** -- unlike a
  coordinate, "is this spigot running" isn't a fact that stays true once
  recorded. `water_sources.csv` holds the static facts (name, type,
  associated trailhead/campground); `water_source_log.csv` is an
  append-only ledger of dated checks against it, the same
  confirms/conflicts pattern as `permit_source_log.csv` generalized to a
  non-permit fact. A later check never overwrites an earlier one -- see
  [`DATA_LICENSE.md`](DATA_LICENSE.md)'s "Known follow-ups" for a live
  example: an official EBRPD page and this project's own trip notes
  currently disagree on whether Boyd Camp has water, and both entries are
  kept rather than one silently overwriting the other.
- **`data/park_access.csv`** -- a park-level vehicle entrance fee, gate
  hours, and fee exemptions, distinct from both a wilderness permit
  (`permits.csv`) and a campsite reservation (`campgrounds.csv`). Some East
  Bay Regional Park District land gates vehicle access with a day-use fee
  entirely independent of any backcountry permit or campsite booking --
  forcing that into `permits.csv`'s quota-season model would leave most of
  its columns meaningless. Confidence is tracked per field, not per row: a
  posted fee and gate hours are independently verifiable against the
  agency's own page, but a fee *exemption* is often something told to a
  visitor verbally at the gate rather than published anywhere -- `notes`
  says which is which rather than implying uniform confidence.

- **`data/timed_entry.csv`** -- whether a park requires a timed-entry
  vehicle reservation is a decision some agencies re-make every year, not a
  standing policy: Yosemite has flipped between requiring one, not
  requiring one, and requiring one only for specific date windows in nearly
  every year since 2020. One row per `(park, year)` by design, so a given
  year's actual policy is a permanent historical record rather than getting
  silently overwritten by the next year's decision -- `policy_for_year()`
  deliberately returns `None` for a year not on file rather than falling
  back to a neighboring year's answer.

`plan` surfaces both what's known and what isn't: a `Facilities` section
with each of these (water status, campground/reservation details, park
entrance fee/hours) for the resolved trip's trailhead, and a "Help us
confirm" section (see "The Scavenger Hunt" below) for what's still missing
or uncertain about them.

```bash
python plan.py "Rose Peak" --date 2027-06-01
```
```text
Facilities
  Water sources at Del Valle (Lichen Bark):
    - Lichen Bark (Del Valle): reported available (checked 2026-09-05)
    - Stromer Springs: running (checked 2026-09-05)
  Campground: Del Valle Family Campground
    Reservation: ReserveAmerica (reserveamerica.com/explore/del-valle)
    Nightly entry cutoff: ~10:00 PM (approximate, not a confirmed posted time) -- ...
  Park access (Del Valle Regional Park):
    Entrance fee: $10 (weekends & holidays, April through Labor Day)
    Gate hours: 6:00 AM-9:00 PM (May through Labor Day)
    Fee exemptions: Vehicles re-entering solely to retrieve a shuttled car ...
```

This links a trailhead to its campgrounds/park access via `Trailhead.park`
(the specific park/preserve unit, e.g. `"Del Valle Regional Park"`) --
deliberately distinct from `wilderness_area` (the backcountry/permit
designation, e.g. `"Ohlone Wilderness"`), since a trailhead's governing
wilderness and its vehicle-access park unit aren't always the same name.
A trailhead with no known `park` (every Sierra trailhead today) simply
shows no `Facilities` section, rather than a guessed link.

## The Scavenger Hunt: Confirming What's Unclear

Some facts in this dataset are marked `unconfirmed`, missing a coordinate,
or flagged `approximate` -- not because no one could find out, but because
no one has checked yet. `wayproof.reports` turns that into a loop instead of
a static disclaimer:

- **`open_questions(...)`** derives the current list of gaps directly from
  the data's own confidence signals (an `unconfirmed` approach status, a
  water source with no coordinates, two availability checks that disagree,
  a note containing "approximate") -- there's no separately maintained,
  hand-authored gap list to fall out of sync.
- **`plan` surfaces gaps relevant to the specific objectives you asked
  about**, right in its output, under "Help us confirm":

  ```bash
  python plan.py "Rose Peak" --date 2027-06-01
  ```
  ```text
  Help us confirm (if you're going, and you check, please report back)
    - We don't have coordinates for Lichen Bark (Del Valle) yet.
    - We don't have coordinates for Stromer Springs yet.
  ```

  This is the point: the nudge shows up exactly when someone is already
  planning to be at that location, not on a separate list they'd have to
  go looking for.
- **The full backlog, across the whole dataset**, not scoped to any one
  trip:

  ```bash
  python cli.py --open-questions
  ```

  This is also where every previously-tracked data-quality item now lives
  -- the 7 peakbagger-sourced coordinates flagged for re-verification, the
  Mount Johnson/Thunder Mountain elevation conflict, secondary-sourced
  `timed_entry.csv` rows -- surfaced live from the data's own confidence
  signals rather than duplicated in a separate to-do list. `DATA_LICENSE.md`'s
  Known follow-ups records *why* each one exists; this command is the
  live, current view of what's actually still open.
- **`report.py`** submits a claim to `data/pending_reports.csv`, an
  append-only intake queue -- deliberately separate from the resolved
  domain ledgers (`water_source_log.csv` etc.), since a submission is a
  claim to review, not yet a fact. This is a standalone tool, not a `plan.py`
  flag: reporting isn't planning -- it's not tied to a trip date, and its
  target doesn't need to already exist in the dataset, so it doesn't belong
  on `plan.py`'s objective/date-resolution flow:

  ```bash
  python report.py submit data/campgrounds.csv "Sunol Backpack Camp" \
    "Has 2 vault-toilet restrooms, no showers" --confidence firsthand
  ```

  That's also exactly how to report a peak missing entirely -- name it as
  the `target_key`, and point `target_file` at `data/peaks.csv`:

  ```bash
  python report.py submit data/peaks.csv "Mount Carillon" \
    "Believed to be a real SPS peak near Mount Russell, not in the dataset" \
    --confidence secondhand
  ```

  `report.py list` shows everything awaiting review; `python cli.py
  --open-questions` prints the same pending-review queue alongside the
  derived gaps, so a submission is visible in the same place as everything
  else, not hidden in a CSV nobody looks at. A maintainer reviews a pending
  report and, if accepted, manually transcribes it into the relevant
  domain CSV (citing the report ID), then closes it out:

  ```bash
  python report.py resolve R0001 accepted --notes "Added to data/peaks.csv, see PR #20"
  ```

  Nothing here writes to a domain dataset automatically -- accepting a
  report is still a deliberate, separate step.

**Why this is built as infrastructure, not a feature of the CLI.**
`open_questions()` and `submit_report()` don't know or care that CLI is
calling them -- they're plain, typed Python functions; `report.py` is a
thin wrapper. Right now this project has exactly one contributor (its
maintainer, populating this by hand from real trips), so CLI is the only
front door. As that changes, each of these becomes an *additional caller*
of the same two functions, not a redesign:

- **a GitHub issue template** (built -- see `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/data_report.md`)
  whose fields map onto `submit_report()`'s parameters. A maintainer reads
  the issue and runs `report.py submit` with `--channel github_issue`,
  the same review step a CLI submission gets;
- **the website itself** (built -- [wayproof.dev](https://wayproof.dev), via
  `scripts/build_site.py`, rebuilt on every push to `main` and daily by
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml`). It renders `open_questions()` on the
  landing page and publishes a page per trailhead (see "The Website" below).
  Its report links reuse the GitHub issue template channel above (pre-filled
  title/question/target file) rather than calling `submit_report()` directly
  -- there's no backend behind the static site to write to
  `data/pending_reports.csv` yet;
- an MCP tool exposing both functions to Claude (not built);
- a ChatGPT Action calling the same two functions (not built);
- a website form that calls `submit_report()` directly, with no GitHub
  account required to use it (not built -- needs a small serverless
  function in front of the static site, since GitHub Pages itself can't
  run one).

The latter three need real hosted infrastructure beyond a static page;
they stay documented extension points until there's a real reason to
build one.

## Destination Zones: Quota By Where You Go

Most permit groups here quota the **entry point** — Inyo NF and Hoover count
people per trailhead, so your trailhead tells you which quota you're competing
for. Desolation Wilderness doesn't work that way. Its quota is assigned per
**destination zone**, and booking asks which of 45 numbered zones you'll spend
your *first night* in; after that night you may move freely, provided you exit
by the last date booked. A day hike needs no zone at all.

That makes a zone a genuinely separate entity from both the trailhead and the
objective — one trailhead reaches many zones, one zone is reachable from several
trailheads — so `data/permit_zones.csv` keys them by `permit_group` rather than
hanging them off a trailhead or peak, the same way `release_policies.csv` holds
release phases that used to be prose.

**What this data deliberately does not say is which zone serves which
objective.** Zone names frequently match a lake or a peak — Aloha, Gilmore,
Dick's Peak, Ralston — which makes name-matching tempting and wrong. A zone is
a mapped boundary; its name is not that boundary. Mount Tallac is the clean
counterexample: it has no zone named for it at all, and its trailhead reaches
several. Both the human and agent surfaces state this non-claim explicitly,
because an agent matching "Ralston Peak" to zone "45 Ralston" is exactly the
inference the data doesn't support. Resolving it needs the official zone map's
geometry, and until that's read it stays an open question.

## Regulations: Stored Once, Inherited

`data/permits.csv` answers *how do I get and keep a permit* — quota, release
dates, fees, cancellation, what makes the document valid. `data/regulations.csv`
answers the separate question of *what rules apply while I'm out there*: fire,
food storage, waste, pets, stock, group size.

Splitting them fixed a real failure rather than a hypothetical one. The
California Campfire Permit requirement is state law (PRC 4433), restated by
every forest, and it had been copy-pasted into **seven** `permits.csv` rows —
where it promptly drifted:

- five of the seven described it as covering a "stove", when it actually covers
  campfires, stoves, **lanterns and barbeques**;
- all of them treated "outside a developed campground" as the trigger, when the
  issuing forest says it's also required *in some developed campgrounds*;
- they offered **three different URLs** between them, and the Eldorado NF page
  itself cites one that doesn't resolve;
- none carried the 18-and-over signer requirement, or the citation
  (36 CFR 261.52(k), PRC 4433).

A fact asserted in seven places is a fact maintained in none of them. And the
consolidated rule was still incomplete: CAL FIRE actually issues **two**
campfire permits, one for federal- and state-controlled lands and one for
private lands, the latter also requiring written permission from the landowner.
A reader who picks the wrong one is carrying an invalid document. The rule now
names which type applies, and warns off the debris-burning permits sold from
the same portal.

So a regulation is now stored once and *inherited*, by `scope_type`:

| Scope | Matches | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `jurisdiction` | `PermitRule.jurisdiction` | California Campfire Permit |
| `agency` | `PermitRule.agency_ids` | Eldorado NF's 10-day dispersed-camping limit |
| `wilderness` | `PermitRule.wilderness_area` | Mokelumne's campfire ban, shared by both its permits |
| `permit_group` | the permit product itself | Desolation's bear canister requirement |

`regulations_for()` resolves all three layers, sorting the specific before the
general so a wilderness's own fire ban reads above the statewide permit rule it
sits on top of. Both the human and agent surfaces label an inherited rule with
its scope, so nobody mistakes state law for one wilderness's local quirk.

This is why `permits.csv` carries an explicit `jurisdiction` column even though
every group in the dataset is currently Californian: *"all our groups are in
California"* is true today by coincidence of coverage, and inheriting statewide
law off that coincidence would break silently the first time a Nevada or Oregon
group is added. There's a test for exactly that.

The `wilderness` layer earned itself immediately. Mokelumne Wilderness is
entered on two different permits — the free general self-issue one and the
quota'd Carson Pass Management Area one — under a single rulebook. Storing
those eleven rules per permit group would have meant maintaining each of them
twice. Both permits now resolve 17 rules with no duplicated row.

### A scope that matches nothing is worse than a missing rule

The agency layer taught this the hard way. The Eldorado NF dispersed-camping
limit was scoped to the agency `Eldorado National Forest`, and **it inherited to
zero permit groups** -- because `permits.csv`'s `agency` column is a *display*
name carrying ranger-district and co-management detail. Desolation's reads
`Eldorado NF / LTBMU`; the Mokelumne groups read
`Eldorado NF (Amador Ranger District)`. None of them is the string the rule
matched on, and nothing said so. The rule looked filed. It applied to nobody.

So `permits.csv` carries `agency_id` alongside `agency`: a stable key for
matching, separate from the prose for reading. It's a *list*, semicolon
separated, because co-management is real -- Desolation is administered jointly
by Eldorado NF and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, and a rule from either
applies. Regulations scope on the key and carry an optional `scope_display` so a
reader still sees "Eldorado National Forest" rather than `eldorado_nf`.

The guard matters more than the fix: a test now asserts that **every**
regulation's scope reaches at least one permit group. A dead scope fails the
build instead of quietly reading as covered. The forest-wide rule now reaches
all three Eldorado groups and shows on 22 trailhead pages.

## `notes` Is Not a Filing Cabinet

Every fact with no better home lands in `permits.csv`'s `notes`, so it accretes.
It was split once — Desolation went from ~3,500 characters to 955 when
regulations moved out — and had grown back to 1,917 before this pass.

Size is the symptom. The disease is that facts with a structured home get
asserted **twice**. Five Mokelumne facts were live in both `notes` and the
wilderness rulebook, created hours apart on the same day, which is exactly how
seven copies of the campfire permit rule drifted apart. Each fact now has one
home:

| Kind of fact | Home |
|---|---|
| What you may do on the ground | `regulations.csv`, scoped and inherited |
| What the permit does **not** cover | `permits.csv` `excludes` |
| How we know, and who disagreed | `permit_source_log.csv`, cited by entry id |
| Season, fees, quota | the structured columns that already exist |

`excludes` earns its own field because being wrong about it is discovered at
the trailhead and cannot be fixed there: the Whitney Zone permit does not cover
the Mountaineers Route or Mount Russell, which need an ordinary Inyo NF permit.
That fact spent seven sentences buried in prose; it now renders above the rules
on all three surfaces.

### Four layers, because one would not hold

The pinned tests below protect the facts already moved. A *new* fact duplicated
tomorrow would pass all of them, so the guard is layered:

| Layer | Catches | Where it fires |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned no-loss tests | a migrated fact vanishing | CI |
| Pinned no-duplication tests | a migrated fact coming back | CI |
| Length cap (1,400 chars) | slow re-accretion | CI |
| Category-vocabulary overlap | **new** duplication | `--open-questions` and the site |

The last one is the general case and it is deliberately **not** a test. Text
similarity does not work here: the Mokelumne duplication was a paraphrase,
sharing no six-word phrase with the rule it restated, only the subject. So the
check asks whether prose mentions the *vocabulary* of a category that already
has a rule for that group — noisy by nature, since prose can mention camping
without restating the camping rule. Breaking the build on it would teach people
to ignore it; surfacing it as a question puts it where a human triages it,
alongside every other gap.

It earned itself immediately: run against the split above it found a group-size
limit still sitting in Desolation's `fee_notes`, and `interagency_note` had to
be exempted because that field exists to describe *other* units' rules.

What deliberately stays in `notes` is genuine miscellany — permit validity
mechanics, cancellation policy, hazards and seasonal access. No single-row
tables were invented for facts that occur once. A test fails any `notes` field
over 1,400 characters, so re-accretion is caught rather than rediscovered.

## Every Claim Cites Its Evidence

`data/permit_source_log.csv` always recorded *why* this project believes
things. What it could not do is tell you which belief a given entry supports —
it was a diary, not an index. So a reader who doubted one sentence had no route
to the evidence for that sentence, and a maintainer who found a source had
changed had no way to learn which rows depended on it.

Both are the same missing edge. Every entry now carries a stable `entry_id`
(`desolation-2026-09-12-11` — sayable, sortable, URL-safe), and claims cite the
ids that established them:

- **Forward**, for a reader: claim → entries → sources. Each rule carries a
  badge with its last check, its sources, and any open argument.
- **Backward**, for ingestion: source URL → entries → claims. A changed page
  names the rows to re-check. A diff on the Desolation permit page implicates
  12 rules today, and no Mokelumne ones.

Status is three-valued, never boolean. `unverified` means nobody logged a
check, which is a different thing from `settled` and must not render like it. A
conflict that was opened and closed counts as settled but stays visible,
because "we considered this and resolved it" tells the next reader more than
silence. A citation that resolves to no entry is reported as a gap: it looks
like evidence and isn't.

## Whose Claim Is It?

Two official sources disagreeing is the normal case, not the exception, and
reconciling them needs three separate judgements. `data/sources.csv` and
`data/source_deferrals.csv` make all three checkable.

**Authority is per topic.** The Forest Service regulates; recreation.gov is the
booking system. Neither outranks the other globally:

| Topic | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `regulation`, `permit_requirement`, `access` | USDA Forest Service | It writes and enforces the rules |
| `booking_mechanics`, `fees`, `availability` | Recreation.gov | It is the thing that books and charges you |

That split is why trusting recreation.gov on the fee tier and the Forest
Service on the day-use season were *both* right.

**Deferrals are observed, not asserted.** Rather than declaring who ought to
win, watch a publisher decline a question — recreation.gov's own permit page
says a day-use permit comes "from a local Forest Service office". Each deferral
is stored with the sentence that establishes it, so it stops being true if the
wording changes. Not every outbound link is a deferral: the same page cites a
2022 trip-planning guide, which endorses a document rather than handing over a
question, and inherits its staleness instead of transferring authority.

**Check for self-contradiction before ranking anyone.** Desolation's day-use
conflict was resolved by ranking the forest above the booking platform —
correctly, but unnecessarily. recreation.gov's overview says a permit is needed
for day visits year-round while its own operational section says day-use
permits come from a Forest Service office "or at trailheads in the summer". It
had already told us which of its statements not to trust. Two of three
conflicts that week were self-contradictions wearing the costume of a
cross-source dispute, so `conflict_kind` records which kind each one is.

**Authority and currency are different axes.** The governing body can be stale
— two permit rows here rest on Forest Service pages last updated in 2021. When
the owner's page is materially older than the non-owner's, `resolve()` refuses
to pick, because a stale regulator page is exactly how a superseded rule
survives online. That is a real open question, not a tie to break.

The rule is tested against every conflict this project has actually resolved
and defended in prose. A model that disagrees with the decisions it was derived
from is wrong.

## The Website

[wayproof.dev](https://wayproof.dev) is generated from this repository's own
data by `scripts/build_site.py` and deployed by GitHub Actions on every push
to `main` -- and once a day besides, because its dated content is computed
relative to the build date and a push-only build would quietly go stale.

**Every page is published three ways** -- HTML for people, Markdown for
agents, JSON for programs:

```text
/trailheads/whitney-portal/        human
/trailheads/whitney-portal.md      agent
/trailheads/whitney-portal.json    structured
```

All three render from a single view model (`wayproof/views.py`) through
`wayproof/render.py`, so they cannot assert different facts -- a property a
site whose whole claim is "these facts are sourced and consistent" can't
treat as optional. The Markdown surface carries provenance and uncertainty
*inline with each claim*, since an agent relaying a permit rule to someone
needs the verification date and the `unconfirmed` flag attached to the
sentence it quotes, not parked in a sidebar. It states its own canonical URL
so it can be cited accurately, and it deliberately contains no instructions
aimed at the reading agent: text telling someone else's tool what to do is
prompt injection, and a source whose entire value is being trustworthy can't
also be one that injects instructions into its readers' agents.

**Trailhead pages lead with the permit that governs entry**, because that is
the trailhead's sourced, authoritative content: agency, quota season, fees,
reservation mechanics, the interagency rule for continuous travel into
neighbouring units, and the append-only verification history from
`data/permit_source_log.csv` -- conflicts and their later resolution included.

*Key dates* are computed in the two shapes the data honestly supports. A
fixed-calendar phase (the Whitney Zone lottery) gets an absolute next date.
A rolling-offset phase has no date of its own -- it opens N days before
*your* entry -- so it gets the inverse framing: which entry date today's
booking window covers.

```text
In season only: Apply start -- next on 2027-02-01.
First release (60% of the quota) -- opens 182 days before your entry date
at 07:00 America/Los_Angeles -- booking today covers entry around 2027-03-13.
```

A phase whose source publishes neither an offset nor a fixed date still
resolves to no date at all, and a permit group with no structured release
policy says so rather than presenting a vaguer answer as an equally precise
one.

**What a trailhead page does *not* assert** is an approach list. Each peak's
`nearest_trailhead` is a geometric assignment computed by
`scripts/assign_trailheads.py`, not a curated relationship, and permits
attach to where you *enter* the wilderness rather than to whichever summit
happens to be closest -- a JMT hiker entering at Happy Isles carries that
permit past peaks whose nearest road is a hundred trail miles away. So
proximity-derived peaks appear only as an explicitly labelled secondary
signal, while `data/approaches.csv`'s sourced rows -- the ones that know
which permit actually governs a named route -- are surfaced as first-class
facts.

## Python Usage

The Python API retains the project's original clustering-oriented names for
compatibility. These names refer to the experimental geographic-discovery
implementation described below.

```python
from wayproof import load_peaks, ClusterConfig
from wayproof.pipeline import plan_trips
from wayproof.export import save_json

peaks = load_peaks("data/peaks.csv", list_filter="SPS",
                    collections_path="data/collections/sps.csv")
groups = plan_trips(peaks, ClusterConfig(eps_mi=6, miles_per_day=15, max_days=3))
save_json(groups, "out.json")
```

## Data

### Peak Data

Peak data is split into two files, per [`DATA_LICENSE.md`](DATA_LICENSE.md)'s
Source Policy: a public-domain-first **core** dataset, and an optional **SPS
collection** layered on top of it. This keeps a mountain's existence from
depending on a private compilation -- only its membership in the SPS
collection does -- and is the same architecture a future non-Sierra-Club
collection (a different range, a different list) would layer onto the same
core.

- **`data/peaks.csv`** (core, collection-agnostic): `name`, `latitude`,
  `longitude`, `elevation_ft`, `elev_estimated`, `coord_source`, `region`,
  the project-computed `nearest_trailhead`/`nearest_trailhead_side`/
  `nearest_trailhead_mi` access signal, and an optional `notes` field for a
  peak-specific data-quality flag (e.g. an unresolved SPS/non-SPS name
  conflict) -- scanned by `wayproof.reports.open_questions()`, see "The
  Scavenger Hunt". A peak's presence here depends only on having a name and
  a location.
- **`data/collections/sps.csv`** (the SPS collection): `list` (`SPS` or
  `non-SPS`), `section`, `class`, `emblem`, `mountaineers`, `mileage_rt`,
  `gain_ft`, `loss_ft`, `trailhead` (named route), `quad`, `benchmark`,
  `benchmark_rating` -- everything that comes specifically from the Sierra
  Club SPS program's own two source documents.

`wayproof.data_loader.load_peaks` joins the two by `name` when given a
`collections_path`; loading `data/peaks.csv` alone works too, just without
collection metadata. Both files are committed and ready to use; the
copyrighted Sierra Club source documents themselves are not redistributed
here. Download them yourself to rebuild; see
[`DATA_LICENSE.md`](DATA_LICENSE.md) and
[`data/source/README.md`](data/source/README.md).

| Source | Used for | Bundled? |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `sps_list_with_mileage.xls` (29th ed., 2025) | 247 SPS peaks: elevation, class, section, round-trip mileage, gain/loss, trailhead, USGS quad, emblem/mountaineers flags | No, Sierra Club copyright |
| `scrambler_ratings_non_sps_2025.pdf` | 354 non-SPS High Sierra peaks, labeled `non-SPS`, tracked but outside current SPS grouping defaults | No, Sierra Club copyright |
| USGS GNIS California + Nevada state files | Decimal lat/long for every peak, matched on name and USGS quad | Yes, public domain |

All 247 SPS peaks have coordinates: 240 from GNIS, including 14
spelling/wording aliases like *Foerster*/*Forester* and *Maclure*/*MacClure*,
and 7 unofficially named peaks (no GNIS entry) from peakbagger.com: Taylor
Dome, Spanish Needle, Rockhouse Peak, Cartago Peak, North Maggie Mountain,
Clyde Minaret, and Rogers Peak. Each row records its `coord_source`. The
peakbagger-sourced coordinates are a known third-party dependency tracked for
independent re-verification -- see [`DATA_LICENSE.md`](DATA_LICENSE.md).

Two peak names ("Mount Johnson", "Thunder Mountain") appear under both
`SPS` and `non-SPS` with conflicting data in the underlying source
documents; the SPS-list entry is kept for both files. See
[`DATA_LICENSE.md`](DATA_LICENSE.md) for that tie-break and the still-open
follow-up to independently resolve which value is correct.

#### Rebuilding The Dataset

Only needed to rebuild from scratch; requires the Sierra Club source documents
in `data/source/`, which are not bundled. The scripts print a download reminder
if they are missing.

```bash
# 1. Parse the Sierra Club sources -> data/sps_peaks.csv (staging, coords blank)
python scripts/build_dataset.py

# 2. Join GNIS coordinates (uses the committed Sierra subset)
python scripts/merge_gnis.py

# 3. Split the staging file into data/peaks.csv + data/collections/sps.csv
python scripts/split_collections.py
```

`scripts/merge_gnis.py` holds the curated alias map and the 7 manual
peakbagger coordinates. `data/source/gnis_sierra_summits.txt` is a trimmed
Sierra-box GNIS subset committed for reproducibility. `data/sps_peaks.csv` is
a git-ignored, rebuild-only staging file -- see
[`data/source/README.md`](data/source/README.md) for the full sequence,
including `scripts/assign_trailheads.py`.

### Trailheads

`data/trailheads.csv` is a curated list of major east-, west-, and crest-side
Sierra trailheads with lat/long coordinates, side of range, wilderness area,
land agency, and `permit_group`. Coordinates are to roughly 0.001 degrees and
spot-checked against public sources such as the PCTA and NPS.

Run:

```bash
python scripts/assign_trailheads.py
```

to add `nearest_trailhead`, `nearest_trailhead_side`, and
`nearest_trailhead_mi` (straight-line) columns to the `data/sps_peaks.csv`
build-staging file (see "Rebuilding The Dataset" above -- these end up in
the committed `data/peaks.csv` core dataset). The nearest-trailhead
assignment is an access signal and can be used for candidate grouping with
`--trailhead-field nearest_trailhead`; it is not proof of the actual approach
a user should take.

### Mountain Passes

`data/passes.csv` is the Sierra pass dataset, sourced from USGS GNIS feature
class `Gap`; see [`data/source/README.md`](data/source/README.md) to rebuild and
backfill elevations. Each pass carries a tier: tier 1 = named passes/cols
(default crossing set, and the points that define the crest line); tier 2 =
minor gaps/saddles.

Pass routing is opt-in. By default all distances are straight-line. With
`--use-passes`, the distance heuristic for a leg between two points on opposite
sides of the Sierra crest is evaluated through the cheapest eligible pass rather
than directly across the ridge; a leg that stays on one side remains direct.
This affects candidate grouping, TSP ordering, reported mileage/gain, and adds a
`passes_crossed` list per group in the JSON.

```bash
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --use-passes
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --use-passes --pass-tier 2
python scripts/assign_trailheads.py --use-passes
```

The crest is approximated by a monotone longitude/latitude line fit over the
tier-1 passes, so peaks sitting almost on the crest can be assigned a side
coarsely; denser pass data (`merge_passes.py --add-all`) sharpens it.

Pass-aware routing is a coarse distance heuristic used by the experimental
grouping system. It does not turn the tool into a terrain-aware route planner.

### Input Schema

Minimum required columns are `name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and
`elevation_ft`. Common aliases like `lat`, `lon`, and `elevation` are accepted.
The core file (`data/peaks.csv`) also optionally carries `elev_estimated`,
`coord_source`, and `nearest_trailhead`/`nearest_trailhead_side`/
`nearest_trailhead_mi`. Collection metadata comes from a separate file joined
by `name` via `load_peaks`'s `collections_path` argument (or
`--collections-file` on the CLI); the bundled SPS collection
(`data/collections/sps.csv`) carries `list`, `class`, `section`, `emblem`,
`mountaineers`, `mileage_rt`, `gain_ft`, `loss_ft`, `trailhead`, `quad`, and
`benchmark`/`benchmark_rating`. All of these flow through to the JSON export
as per-peak `attributes`. JSON input is also supported as a list of objects
or `{"peaks": [...]}` -- collection fields can simply be included inline in
that case, same as any other JSON peak record.

## Experimental: Geographic Trip Discovery

The original clustering system remains useful as a research and discovery
feature.

It asks a narrower question than the overall product:

**Which SPS summits appear geographically related enough to investigate as a
possible multi-objective trip?**

It does not answer:

**What route should I actually travel through the mountains?**

The current pipeline uses geographic distance, elevation-based effort
heuristics, capacity splitting, optional pass-aware distance adjustments, and
TSP-style ordering to produce candidate groupings and candidate sequences.

### Important Limitation

Candidate groupings are based on geographic proximity, estimated effort, and
available approach data. They do not model cliffs, technical terrain, trail
topology, snow or ice conditions, creek crossings, private-property barriers,
route-specific hazards, or all required descents and reclimbs.

Treat them as hypotheses to investigate, not verified routes.

### Distance And Effort Model

- **Horizontal distance**: great-circle (haversine) miles between summits. This
  is a geometric proxy, not evidence of travel feasibility.
- **Naismith's Rule**: 1 hour per 3 horizontal miles plus 1 hour per 2000 feet
  of ascent, so 2000 feet of climbing is about 3 effective flat miles. Effective
  miles are summed leg-by-leg; descending adds no penalty in the standard simple
  form.
- **Trip budget**: `max_effective_mi = miles_per_day x max_days` (default
  `15 x 3 = 45`). Estimated days = `ceil(effective_mi / miles_per_day)`, capped
  at `max_days`.
- **Elevation gain**: the sum of positive summit-to-summit deltas along the
  candidate sequence, a lower bound that ignores intermediate ups and downs.

### Approach Modeling (`--include-approach`)

By default, candidate sequences cover only summit-to-summit travel. With
`--include-approach`, the tool also estimates the trailhead approach: the walk
from the car to the first summit and the descent from the last summit back,
using `data/trailheads.csv`.

1. **Trailhead choice.** Each candidate group is associated with the trailhead
   that best serves it: the most common `nearest_trailhead` among its peaks
   (ties broken by proximity to the group centroid), falling back to the
   trailhead nearest the centroid.
2. **Re-anchored sequencing.** The trailhead can be included as a fixed
   start/end node and the group is solved as a closed tour (`solve_tsp_cycle`),
   so the entry and exit summits are chosen to minimize the whole loop, not just
   inter-peak travel.
3. **Approach cost (hybrid).** Each in/out leg is priced from the data already
   available: when the chosen trailhead is that peak's standard
   `nearest_trailhead`, the model derives the approach estimate from the peak's
   sourced `mileage_rt` and `gain_ft` data; otherwise it falls back to
   great-circle distance times a sinuosity factor (default `1.25`) with the
   trailhead-to-summit elevation delta. The inbound leg ascends and gets the
   Naismith penalty; the outbound leg descends and does not. A single-peak group
   reduces exactly to the official round trip when known mileage/gain data is
   available.

The approach estimate is folded into `total_distance_mi`, `total_effective_mi`,
`total_elevation_gain_ft`, `estimated_days`, and `efficiency_score`, and
reported separately as `approach_*` plus `trailhead` / `trailhead_side`.

Approach modeling estimates planning effort. It does not prove that the selected
trailhead-to-objective connection is the correct, legal, or technically feasible
route.

```bash
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --include-approach --max-days 2 -o weekend.json
```

> **Approach-aware capacity splitting.** With `--include-approach`, the effort
> budget is enforced including the approach: capacity splitting starts from the
> inter-peak floor (the fewest groups the bare traverse allows) and tightens only
> if a modest extra split actually makes the groups fit once the walk-in is
> counted. Because the approach is largely a fixed per-group cost, the splitter
> will not fragment a group when splitting cannot help; an approach-dominated
> group stays whole rather than paying the approach several times over.

### Approach-Amortization Report (`--approach-report`)

A long approach can behave like a fixed cost paid once per trip. If several
candidate trips use the same trailhead, planning them separately may repeat
substantial access mileage. `--approach-report` looks for trailheads serving
multiple candidate groups and estimates how much repeated approach effort might
be avoided if those objectives could be repacked into fewer trips within the
configured day budget.

```bash
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --approach-report --max-days 3
```

```text

...
8 trailheads serve multiple trips; ~31.6 effective approach-mi potentially
recoverable by repacking within the day budget.
```

Output fields:

- `trips` - how many current candidate groups use the trailhead.
- `peaks` - how many objectives those groups contain.
- `appr_mi` - total estimated approach effort currently paid across those
  groups.
- `per_trip` - average approach effort per current group.
- `min_trips` - the minimum number of trips implied by the combined configured
  effort budget.
- `save_mi` - estimated repeated approach effort that could be avoided if that
  lower trip count were achievable.

This report is a planning signal, not a route recommendation. A high estimated
savings value means "these objectives repeatedly pay for the same access and may
be worth investigating together." It does not mean the objectives can actually
be connected safely or sensibly in the field.

### Permit Report (`--permits`)

Every trailhead in `data/trailheads.csv` is tagged with a wilderness area,
issuing agency, and a `permit_group` key into `data/permits.csv`, a curated
table of permit type, quota season, reservation window/method, fees, and the
official apply URL for each agency covering the SPS range. That includes Inyo
NF, Sierra NF, Sequoia NF, Stanislaus NF, Eldorado NF/LTBMU, Humboldt-Toiyabe
NF, Yosemite NP, and Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP, including the separate Mt.
Whitney Zone lottery.

`--permits` implies `--include-approach`, since it needs each candidate group's
chosen trailhead. It prints the permit type, whether `--trip-date` falls in that
area's quota season, and, when applicable, when the reservation window opens
relative to today:

```bash
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --permits --trip-date 2027-07-15 --max-days 3
```

```text
Group #2 -- Whitney Portal  (trip date 2027-07-15)
  Wilderness: Mount Whitney Zone (John Muir Wilderness)  |  Agency: Inyo National Forest
  Permit: Mount Whitney Zone Permit
  Status: Lottery for 2027 opens Feb 1; apply by Mar 1.
  Fee: $15/person plus $6 processing fee
  Apply: https://www.recreation.gov/permits/445860
```

Run it once per candidate month across a 12-month planning window, or loop
`--trip-date` over several dates, to see which candidate groups need a lottery
entry, a 6-month rolling reservation, a day-of walk-up, or nothing at all.

### Computable Release Rules

*When* a permit's reservation inventory actually opens used to live only as
prose in `permits.csv`'s `reservation_method` column. That meant a group with
a percentage-split release -- 60% of the quota six months out, the remaining
40% two weeks out, say -- only ever had its *first* release date computed;
the second release existed only as a sentence a human had to read, never as
a date the tool itself could act on.

`data/release_policies.csv` (loaded by `wayproof/release_policy.py`)
records each permit_group's release cycle as an ordered list of phases
instead, so every dated event is computable, not just the first one. Four
mechanisms cover every case in the current dataset:

| Mechanism | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `reservation` | Opens at a computed date, then first-come online. A group can have more than one -- each with its own `allocation_pct` | Inyo NF's 60% at 6 months, 40% at 2 weeks |
| `lottery_annual` | Fixed calendar dates every year, independent of the trip date | Mount Whitney Zone's Feb 1 - Mar 1 application window |
| `walkup` | In person, day-of, first-come, no advance reservation | Carson Pass Management Area in season |
| `contact_required` | Not self-issue and not walk-up -- call or email the agency | Carson Pass Management Area off season |

A phase can be scoped to `season = in_season` or `off_season` when a permit
group's mechanics genuinely differ by season -- Whitney Zone's annual lottery
only governs in-season trips; a winter trip uses a completely different
(and much simpler) online-reservation mechanism, not a lottery with a footnote.

This never fabricates a date: when a source states an allocation split
without a specific release offset (Sierra NF's remaining ~40%, "released for
shorter-notice/walk-up-style booking" with no exact day given), that phase's
date is left unresolved and its `notes` field is surfaced instead of a
guess.

**Not every permit_group is migrated.** Yosemite's weekly lottery cycle is
deliberately left on its own special-cased logic in `wayproof/permits.py`
-- its own source states that exact per-area reservation dates come from a
downloadable dataset that hasn't been retrieved, so forcing weekday-precise
computed dates onto an already-approximate source would manufacture false
precision rather than remove it. A permit_group absent from
`release_policies.csv` simply falls back to the older, coarser
single-release-date logic.

```bash
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --permits --trip-date 2027-07-15 \
  --release-policies-file data/release_policies.csv
```

```text
Status: Reservations open 2027-01-14 (07:00 America/Los_Angeles) -- mark your
calendar. A further 40% release opens 2027-07-01 (07:00 America/Los_Angeles).
```

## Manual Grouping And Overrides

Manual grouping controls let a human override heuristic grouping when real-world
route knowledge is better than the geometry:

```bash
# Force the Palisade 14ers together, exclude a sub-peak, tighten the daily budget.
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv \
  --force-together "NORTH PALISADE,Polemonium Peak,Thunderbolt Peak,Mount Sill" \
  --exclude "Mount Muir" --miles-per-day 12 --max-days 2

python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --merge 5,6
python cli.py -i data/peaks.csv --split 4:2
```

`--merge` applies to first-pass IDs; `--split` applies afterward. After each
edit, candidate sequences are recomputed and groups are re-ranked so metrics
stay consistent.

A manual override is not proof that a route is valid. It is simply an explicit
planning decision.

## Output Schema

The JSON schema still uses historical names such as `clusters`,
`cluster_id`, and `recommended_order` for compatibility. Semantically, read them
as candidate groups and candidate sequences.

```jsonc
{
  "summary": {
    "num_clusters": 53,
    "total_peaks": 247,
    "total_estimated_days": 69,
    "total_distance_mi": 407.43,
    "total_elevation_gain_ft": 43081
  },
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": 0,
      "num_peaks": 12,
      "peaks": [
        {
          "name": "MOUNT SILL",
          "latitude": 37.0942,
          "longitude": -118.5042,
          "elevation_ft": 14159,
          "attributes": {
            "list": "SPS",
            "class": "3",
            "section": 14.4,
            "emblem": false,
            "mountaineers": false,
            "mileage_rt": 11.9,
            "gain_ft": 7685,
            "trailhead": "...",
            "quad": "North Palisade",
            "coord_source": "GNIS"
          }
        }
      ],
      "recommended_order": ["Disappointment Peak", "Middle Palisade", "..."],
      "total_distance_mi": 9.0,
      "total_effective_mi": 11.2,
      "total_elevation_gain_ft": 1479,
      "estimated_days": 1,
      "efficiency_score": 5.66,
      "emblem_peaks": 1,
      "mountaineers_peaks": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

With `--include-approach`, each group also carries `trailhead`,
`trailhead_side`, `approach_distance_mi`, `approach_effective_mi`, and
`approach_gain_ft`, and the `total_*` figures include that approach.

`total_distance_mi`, `total_effective_mi`, and `total_elevation_gain_ft` are
the inter-peak candidate-sequence totals computed by the heuristic. Each peak's
`attributes` also carry the official per-peak round-trip `mileage_rt` /
`gain_ft` from the trailhead, for reference.

## Methodology, Rebuilding, And Development

### Example SPS Candidate Grouping

With default settings, the current SPS dataset produces 53 candidate groups
across the range. A few of the top-ranked:

| # | Peaks | Days | Eff. mi | Gain | Candidate group |
|---|------:|-----:|--------:|-----:|-----------------|
| 0 | 12 | 1 | 11.2 | 1,479 | **Palisades** - Middle Pal, Norman Clyde, Sill, N. Palisade, Thunderbolt, Agassiz, Temple Crag... |
| 1 | 13 | 2 | 16.1 | 1,332 | **Evolution** - Darwin, Mendel, Lamarck, Goethe, Huxley, Haeckel, Powell, Thompson, Goode... |
| 2 | 11 | 2 | 15.8 | 2,211 | **Whitney/Williamson** - Whitney, Muir, Russell, Williamson, Tyndall, Barnard... |
| 3 | 7 | 1 | 6.9 | 676 | **Brewer group** - Brewer, North/South Guard, Table, Midway, Milestone... |
| 6 | 16 | 3 | 33.6 | 2,710 | **Mono Divide** - Abbot, Mills, Gabb, Dade, Bear Creek Spire, Hilgard, Recess... |
| 12 | 9 | 2 | 22.5 | 793 | **Sawtooth/Matterhorn** - Matterhorn, Whorl, Virginia, Conness, North Peak, Dunderberg... |

A small 30-peak demo dataset (`data/sps_sample.csv`) and its output are also
included for quick experimentation.

### Notes, Assumptions, And Extension Points

- **Geographic discovery assumption.** Inter-peak travel uses straight-line
  great-circle distance unless pass-aware routing is enabled. This does not
  model cliffs, technical terrain, or full trail topology.
- **Trail-network distances (optional future work).** The distance layer is
  isolated in `distances.py`; replacing `build_distance_matrix` with shortest
  paths over a `networkx` graph built from USFS/NPS trail shapefiles would leave
  much of the downstream grouping code unchanged.
- **Elevation gain** is the sum of positive summit-to-summit deltas along the
  candidate sequence, a lower bound that ignores intermediate ups and downs.
- **Permits** are a planning aid, not a booking system. `data/permits.csv` is a
  manually curated snapshot of quota seasons, reservation windows, and lottery
  timing, which agencies change from year to year. It does not call
  recreation.gov or check live availability.
